    <!-- EDIT THIS SECTION TO CHANGE YOUR ABOUT ME -->
    <p> I am a dedicated, ambitious first-year student at the University of Michigan, currently pursuing a computer science major through the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. I am very interested in working in the intersection of finance and computer science.
        <br />
        <br />
I currently have experience in C++, Python, and Java as well as web development. In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis, trying a variety of new recipes, or reading. Feel free to contact me about anything!
    <br />
    <br />
    This year I have just completed an introductory computer science course offered at UofM. Within this course, I was able to not only learn how to build several projects including a simulated elevator game, I was also given strong foundational skills on how to approach programming problems. The course was taught in C++ and I was able to work with a variety of group members throughout the semester. From this class and others, I have gained the ability to collaborate effectively despite the difficult virtual setting of the class.
